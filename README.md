I'll try to do this in Haskell ðŸ˜Ž... wish me luck. 

 - Day 1: âœ… (why did I choose Haskell... it's gonna be a long month)
 - Day 2: âœ… (that was... surprisingly easy... I'm gonna credit that to my exceptional Haskell skillz ðŸ˜Ž)
 - Day 3: âœ… (part 1 was quite easy.... but got lost during part 2...should've read the puzzle instructions in full... GARBAGE CODE - BUT IT WORKS!)
